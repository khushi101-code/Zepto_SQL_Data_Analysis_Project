# Zepto_SQL_Data_Analysis_Project| Real-World SQL Portfolio Project

This is a complete, real-world **Data Analyst Portfolio Project** based on an e-commerce inventory dataset scraped from **Zepto** ‚Äì one of India‚Äôs fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. This project simulates real analyst workflows using SQL, from raw data exploration to deriving business-focused insights.

## üìå Project Objective
To simulate how data/business analysts in the e-commerce or retail sector use SQL to:

- Set up a **messy, real-world e-commerce inventory database**
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies
- Apply **Data Cleaning** to handle nulls, remove invalid entries, and standardize pricing
- Write **business-driven SQL queries** to derive insights around pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue, and more

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Overview

The dataset was originally scraped from Zepto‚Äôs product listings and is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). It mimics what analysts face in real e-commerce environments.

Each row represents a **unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)**. Duplicate product names exist due to different package sizes, weights, or discounts ‚Äî similar to real-world catalogs.

**Columns:**
- `sku_id`: Unique identifier (synthetic primary key)
- `name`: Product name
- `category`: Product category (e.g., Fruits, Snacks, Beverages)
- `mrp`: Maximum Retail Price (originally in paise, converted to ‚Çπ)
- `discountPercent`: Discount on MRP
- `discountedSellingPrice`: Final selling price (in ‚Çπ)
- `availableQuantity`: Inventory units available
- `weightInGms`: Product weight in grams
- `outOfStock`: Boolean flag for stock status
- `quantity`: Package quantity or mixed units (for loose produce)
